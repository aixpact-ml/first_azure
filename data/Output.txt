CAREER SUMMARY

For many years I worked in the Fashion Industry, as Buying/Sourcing Manager, with companies around the world dealing with people of diverse backgrounds and cultures. I built sustainable and profitable networks of suppliers and managed huge amount of orders/purchase contracts representing millions of Euro’s. In all jobs I quickly gained full trust and paid back by results in profit and business excellence. I accomplished this by:
Learning fast what matters most to safeguard stakeholders.
Organising tasks by using a proactive and data driven approach.
Staying calm and organised under pressure and in a fast-paced and dynamic environment, while keeping the helicopter/holistic view.
Finding common grounds to solve complex issues by expertise (data), respect,  patience and strategic or out-of-the-box thinking.
Being a true multidisciplinary-multi-tasker, ‘a 5-legged sheep’.
Work hard, stay curious, stay modest and enjoy.
In 2016 I changed course and followed my heart to study Computer and Data Science.
My goal is to work as a Data Scientist consulting for companies who need expertise to transform their organisation to be data driven and develop(hands-on) AI solutions to improve their business models, strategy, operational excellence and as result to safeguard stakeholders and sustainability.
